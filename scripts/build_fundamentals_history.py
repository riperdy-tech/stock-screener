"""build_fundamentals_history.py — 10-year fundamentals + value-trap battery
from the SEC companyfacts bulk archive.

Reads companyfacts.zip (SEC XBRL frames, ~19.7K CIK files) directly — no
extraction to disk — for every ticker in stocks.json, builds an annual
fundamentals history (revenue, margins, cash flow, balance sheet, shares),
and computes the value-trap battery the audit found missing:

  - Piotroski F-Score (9 checks, reported with how many were computable)
  - Sloan accruals ratio ((NI - CFO) / avg assets; high = earnings not cash)
  - Net share issuance (1y and 3y CAGR of diluted shares)
  - Beneish M-Score (real 8-ratio computation; replaces the old -2.0
    placeholder; missing ratios neutralized and reported, never invented)
  - 10y revenue/operating-margin arrays (mid-cycle inputs for cyclicals)

Outputs:
  public/data/fundamentals_history.json — ticker -> {years: {fy: {...}}}
  public/data/fundamentals_battery.json — ticker -> battery summary
  (battery is the file scoring code should consume; history is the audit trail)

Usage:
  python scripts/build_fundamentals_history.py                 # full universe
  python scripts/build_fundamentals_history.py --limit 50      # smoke run
  python scripts/build_fundamentals_history.py --tickers NVDA,LLY
  python scripts/build_fundamentals_history.py --refresh-one NVDA   # live SEC, patch in place

--refresh-one fetches ONE company's companyfacts live from data.sec.gov (same structure as
one member of the bulk zip, always current), runs the identical extraction, and patches only
that ticker's rows into the four production files (tmp + os.replace; every other ticker
byte-untouched; provenance rides along). LOCAL-ONLY: the patched files must never be
committed — data on git comes only from the cloud's fresh-zip rebuild, which reproduces
the same rows from the same facts and dissolves the patch. Exit 0 = rows updated (or
already identical); non-zero = fetch/extract failure, files untouched.

Data honesty rules: a metric that cannot be computed is null with its gaps
reported — no neutral-looking defaults.

# filing, "most recent wins" picks it every time. Verified against the raw companyfacts:
#     COHR  FY2023 D&A          681,687,000 (10-K)   vs      681,687,000,000 (later 10-K)

# -- FIELD SPECS (2026-08-20) -------------------------------------------------------------
# Curated against companyfacts.zip over the 269-ticker book (2,917 ticker-years); every proposal
# adversarially re-verified against filed cash-flow statements before landing here.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. annual_duration_series picks ONE winning tag per field -- most-recent-latest-
# year, then coverage -- and never mixes tags. That is right per tag (see its docstring: AAPL's
# SalesRevenueNet has 11 old years ending 2017) but it silently drops years the WINNER lacks even
# when another ALREADY-MAPPED tag covers them. Measured: that single effect is ~85% of the
# revenue / pretax / ocf nulls. Adding tag names does nothing for it; stitching does.
#
# THREE MECHANISMS, strict order:
#   COMBINED        priority list, each usable ALONE. Primary = today's winner (unchanged, so
#                   every year currently filled stays byte-identical); the rest BACKFILL only
#                   years the primary lacks.
#   COMPONENT_SLOTS at most ONE tag per slot, summed ACROSS slots, and only if EVERY slot
#                   resolves. A partial sum is not an approximation, it is a wrong number:
#                   amortisation-slot alone runs a median 0.222 of true D&A, depreciation-slot
#                   alone 0.925 (n=1822 paired observations).
#   LONE_DEPRECIATION_ALLOWLIST  da only. A filer whose depreciation tag IS its entire D&A line,

        # Per-field most-recent-wins mixes FILING BASES inside one row: after a divestiture
        # the next 10-K restates comparative revenue to continuing operations, while net
        # income under our tags keeps the original consolidated figure — WDC FY2023 ended up
        # with HDD-only revenue ($6.25B, restated) against the consolidated flash-crash loss
        # (−$1.68B), a margin of two different companies. Measured across the live book: 314
        # basis-suspect conflicts (>30% or sign-flip) on 88 tickers, and no filed-date
        # preference survives them all (original-first breaks ASC-606-style restatements
        # where the later figure is better; latest-first is what mixed WDC). So instead of
        # judging vintages, assemble each year-row from ONE filing: the accession covering
        # the most fields (tie -> latest filed). The per-period/series scale defences above
        # stay authoritative: an accession value that contradicts the resolved series by a
        # clean power of 1000 is refused (COHR-class corrupt filings must not win a row),
        # and a zero contradicted by a nonzero resolved value is a filing artifact (PSMT
        # revenue 0 vs $2.5B), not data.
        # BIN-END ANCHOR. Year bins are calendar end-year (int(end[:4])), and fiscal years
        # ending Jan 1-2 COLLIDE with the prior year's bin: without this anchor the accession-
        # coverage rule installed JNJ FY2016's $16.54B net income as "2017" (JNJ FY2016 ended
        # 2017-01-01), ILMN's FY2022 GRAIL-impairment loss as "2023", YETI FY2021 as "2022" —
        # found by diffing the full rebuild against the previous production file. The bin's
        # canonical period end is its LATEST end date (deterministic — a filed-date anchor
        # ties, because one later 10-K carries BOTH years as comparatives under one filed
        # date): the collision candidate always ends Jan 1-2 of year y, the bin's own fiscal
        # year always ends later in y. Only candidates within 14 days of the anchor may join
